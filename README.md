# JavaFlickrGUI

Java application that grabs images from flickr.com and shows them in GUI.

I created this application to learn:
* Java syntax
* Swing
* Java Threads
* Flickr API

## How to run application
```
cd dist/
java -jar JavaFlickrGUI.jar
```

## Notes

Code is bad. Refactoring should be done.
